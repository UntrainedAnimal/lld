/*

If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach to use.
But in most of the scenarios, singleton classes are created for resources such as File System, Database connections, etc.
We should avoid the instantiation unless the client calls the getInstance method. Also, this method doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling.
